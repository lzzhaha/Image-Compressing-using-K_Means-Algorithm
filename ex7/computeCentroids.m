%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids =[];

for i=1:K
  temp_idx = (idx == i);
  num_points = sum(temp_idx);
  new_cent = (1/num_points)*(X' * temp_idx);
  centroids = [centroids;new_cent'];
